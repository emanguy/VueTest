# Messing with Vue.js

I wanted to try getting into Vue after Polymer never really got the attention that I would
have liked it to have. In order to do so, I wrote up this simple webpage based on the vue starter
project which takes a list of grocery list categories in JS, then lets you add items in those categories.

This is a really interesting project for me because I really wanted to test how dynamic an app in Vue.js
could really get, and it worked out pretty well!

## Running

I wrote this project using the Vue CLI and Yarn. Assuming you already have yarn:

    yarn global add @vue/cli
    yarn install
 
You can now serve the webpage using `yarn run serve` and run the unit tests I wrote with `yarn run test:unit`.
